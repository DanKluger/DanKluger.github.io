As a statistician and interdisciplinary researcher, I am broadly interested in developing and deploying statistical methods for applications in agriculture and remote sensing. My current research is on methods for conducting reliable statistical analyses that leverage widely available, yet error-prone proxies.</p> <p>Recently, I completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford University, where I was grateful to be advised by Professors <a href="https://artowen.su.domains/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Art Owen</a> and <a href="https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">David Lobell</a> and supported as a James and Nancy Kelso <a href="https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellow</a>. While at Stanford, my research areas included multiple hypothesis testing, causal inference, data fusion, measurement error, crop rotation, and crop type mapping. Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Statistics &amp; Data Science at Yale University.</p> </body></html>
