I am a [Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/ses-funding/hammer-fellows/) at the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/), where I am fortunate to be hosted by Professors [Sherrie Wang](https://sherriewang.github.io/) and [Stephen Bates](https://stephenbates19.github.io/). As a statistician and interdisciplinary researcher, I am broadly interested in developing and deploying statistical methods for applications in agriculture and remote sensing. My current focus is on developing methods for conducting reliable statistical analyses that leverage widely available, yet error-prone predictions.

Recently, I completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford University, where I was grateful to be advised by Professors [Art Owen](https://artowen.su.domains/) and [David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) and supported as a James and Nancy Kelso [Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellow](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf). While at Stanford, my research areas included multiple hypothesis testing, causal inference, data fusion, measurement error, crop rotation, and crop type mapping. Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. in Mathematics at Yale University and also majored in Statistics & Data Science.
