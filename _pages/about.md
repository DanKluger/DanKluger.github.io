I am a [Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/ses-funding/hammer-fellows/) at the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/), where I am fortunate to be hosted by Professors [Sherrie Wang](https://sherriewang.github.io/) and [Stephen Bates](https://stephenbates19.github.io/). SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MY RESEARCH INTERESTS OR WHO I AM?

Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford University, advised by [Art Owen](https://artowen.su.domains/) and [David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell). SAY STANFORD FELLOWSHIPS?? YALE MATH?
