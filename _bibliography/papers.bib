abstract = {Studies of attention emphasize cortical circuits for salience monitoring and top-down control. However, subcortical arousal systems have a major influence on dynamic cortical state. We hypothesize that task-related increases in attention begin with a “pulse” in subcortical arousal and cortical attention networks, which are reflected indirectly through transient fMRI signals. We conducted general linear model and model-free analyses of fMRI data from two cohorts and tasks with mixed block and event-related design. 46 adolescent subjects at our center and 362 normal adults from the Human Connectome Project participated. We identified a core shared network of transient fMRI increases in subcortical arousal and cortical salience/attention networks across cohorts and tasks. Specifically, we observed a transient pulse of fMRI increases both at task block onset and with individual task events in subcortical arousal areas including midbrain tegmentum, thalamus, nucleus basalis and striatum; cortical-subcortical salience network regions including the anterior insula/claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area; in dorsal attention network regions including dorsolateral frontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule; as well as in motor regions including cerebellum, and left hemisphere hand primary motor cortex. The transient pulse of fMRI increases in subcortical and cortical arousal and attention networks was consistent across tasks and study populations, whereas sustained activity in these same networks was more variable. The function of the transient pulse in these networks is unknown. However, given its anatomical distribution, it could participate in a neuromodulatory surge of activity in multiple parallel neurotransmitter systems facilitating dynamic changes in conscious attention.}

abstract = {Abstract Objective Clinicians rely on patient self-report of impairment during seizures for decisions including driving eligibility. However, the reliability of patient reports on cognitive and behavioral functions during seizures remains unknown. Methods We administered a daily questionnaire to epilepsy patients undergoing continuous video-EEG monitoring, asking about responsiveness, speech, memory, awareness, and consciousness during seizures in the preceding 24 hours. We also administered a questionnaire upon admission about responsiveness, speech, and awareness during seizures. Subjective questionnaire answers were compared with objective behavioral ratings on video review. Criteria for agreement were Cohen’s kappa >0.60 and proportions of positive and negative agreement both >0.75. Results We analyzed 86 epileptic seizures in 39 patients. Memory report on the daily questionnaire met criteria for agreement with video review (κ = 0.674 for early, 0.743 for late recall). Subjective report of awareness also met agreement criteria with video ratings of memory (κ = 0.673 early, 0.774 late). Concordance for speech was relatively good (κ = 0.679) but did not meet agreement criteria, nor did responsiveness or consciousness. On the admission questionnaire, agreement criteria were met for subjective report of awareness versus video ratings of memory (κ = 0.814 early, 0.806 late), but not for other comparisons. Interpretation Patient self-report of memory or awareness showed the best concordance with objective memory impairment during seizures. Self-report of impairment in other categories was less reliable. These findings suggest that patient reports about impaired memory during seizures may be most reliable, and otherwise determining functional impairments should be based on objective observations.},
